# Personal website

A website that holds all of my earlier subdomains and such.

A better Readme needs to created and everything inside this repository needs to be redesigned and updated to fit this new workflow.

- Projects - This website is not done yet so please return to the main page. (This
  will hold all projects and not only games thich it was earlier. Games will be
  under https://pontushenriksson.com/projects#games)

- All static content should be places in https://github.com/pontushenriksson/static-library and all content should therefore be moved into there before changing anything else.
