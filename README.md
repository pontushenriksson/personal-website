# Personal website

A website that holds all of my earlier subdomains and such.

# This needs to be cleaned up

A better Readme needs to created and everything inside this repository needs to be redesigned and updated to fit this new workflow.

- Projects - This website is not done yet so please return to the main page. (This
  will hold all projects and not only games thich it was earlier. Games will be
  under https://pontushenriksson.com/projects#games)

- All static content should be places in https://github.com/pontushenriksson/static-library and all content should therefore be moved into there before changing anything else.

## Current bugs:

- Certificates doesn't scroll to the top of the section when view all button is clicked? - It maybe does but it feels like it does it only at random.
- When it scrolls it scrolls up to little. It should probably use a negative offset when using the smoothscroll.
- The ZippiUX project youtube video is sized weirdly. Make it take up as much space as the other thumbnails.

## TODO:

- Create and develop these layouts:
  - Testimonials
- Add a new Lotus image instead of the current LLS-vscode image
- Add animations

# TODO:

- Fix profile image.
- Fix sitemap.
- Fix robots.txt.
- Pick one of the two spotify cards that are currently on the page.
- Create and add a video displaying my work.
- MAKE STUDYPAL UF ONLINE AND CHANGE TO BRAND COLOR.
